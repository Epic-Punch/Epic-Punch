Run index.html through a localhost or live server on vsCode

Use new branch to change code, then once one issue has been solved then we will commit to main branch and so on with all issues

You can add issues if you feel like we need to spend some time on a feature.
If you are working on an issue also just assign that issue to yourself so we can keep track of whos doing what
